                We present our recent result on the inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes on  $\mathbb{R}^2$, with initial vorticity to be the sum of point vortices 
                and a smooth, compactly supported part away from the point vortices. In the vanishing viscosity limit, we obtain the 'vortex-wave system', 
                which was introduced by Marchioro and Pulvirenti in the early 90s. This, for the first time, physically justifies the vortex wave system 
                directly from the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a joint work with Toan Nguyen, Penn State University.

                Many models in physics can be derived by some sort of hyperbolic conservation laws, such as wave propagation, gas dynamics or traffic flow. 
                The presence of shockwaves requires some special techniques to deal with the well-posedness of these problems. In this talk, we investigate 
                the scalar conservation law and introduce a Lagrangian representation for the entropy solution. The existence and uniqueness of Lagrangian solutions 
                are guaranteed by Filippov theory of differential equations. We prove that such a Lagrangian solution is compatible with the front tracking and 
                vanishing viscosity approximations in the sense that the approximate Lagrangian solution given by either of these methods converges uniformly 
                to the Lagrangian solution corresponding to the entropy solution of scalar conservation laws. For certain flux functions, illustrated by traffic 
                flow, we are able to obtain the convergence rates for the approximate Lagrangian solution with respect to changes in the initial field or flux 
                function by combining the front tracking method with Filippov theory. If time permits, we present an application of this approach in some Bayesian 
                inverse problems of recovering the initial field or flux function by tracking a particle trajectory.

                $C_H(V)$ the Hardy constant relative to $V$ in $\Omega$. <br>

                $\gamma < C_H(V)$  and $f \in C(\R)$ is an odd, monotone increasing function. 
                We establish the existence of a normalized boundary trace for positive solutions of (LE)  and employ it to investigate the behavior

                Wang and Ye (2012) prove the following Hardy-Moser-Trudinger inequality in the unit disc The preceding inequality which improves both 
                the classical Moser-Trudinger inequality and the classical Hardy inequality in the unit disc. The proof of Wang and Ye is based on the 
                blow- up analysis method which seems not work in the higher dimensions. In this talk, we propose a new approach based on the method of 
                transplantation of Green’s functions to reprove the inequality of Wang and Ye and generalize it both to the higher dimensional unit ball 
                and to the singular weighted cases as well. As a consequence, we obtain a singular Moser- Trudinger inequality in the hyperbolic spaces 
                which confirms affirmatively a conjecture by Mancini, Sandeep and Tintarev.

                Probabilistic methods have been used to study diffusion equations since the 1940s by Kato, Feynmann, Kac, Kolmogorov and other mathematicians. 
                In 1975, McKean modeled the KPP equation (which is a differential equation of the form u_t – u_xx = u^2 - u) by a stochastic branching process.
                His approach is general enough to apply to a larger class of nonlinear parabolic equations. In 1997, Le Jan and Sznitmann adapted McKean’s 
                method to the Navier-Stokes equations, opening an interesting approach, probabilistic in nature, to study the well-posedness of these equations. 
                In this talk, I will go over some main ideas in McKean’s and Le Jan – Sznitmann’s approach and their applications to some simple/familiar 
                differential equations.

                where $(1/2,1)$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain and $\mu\in M(\Omega,\delta^\gamma)$, $\gamma\in [0,1]$. 
                To do this, we first develop a theory for the corresponding linear equations with homogeneous boundary conditions. Based on the linear theory, 
                we show that, under a certain subcritical integrability condition on the nonlinear term g, there exists a unique solution of 
                the Dirichlet problem for every $\mu\in M(\Omega,\delta^\gamma)$. In the case $\mu$ is a Dirac mass, we characterize the asymptotic behavior 
                of solutions near the singular point. This is a joint work with Phuoc Tai Nguyen
