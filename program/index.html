                Triebel–Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^{\alpha,L},{p,q}(X)$ associated to the operator $L$ for the full range $0 < p,q \le \infty$ and

                The inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations for vortex-wave data

                We present our recent result on the inviscid limit of Navier-Stokes on  $\mathbb{R}^2$, with initial vorticity to be the sum of point vortices 
                and a smooth, compactly supported part away from the point vortices. In the vanishing viscosity limit, we obtain the 'vortex-wave system', 
                which was introduced by Marchioro and Pulvirenti in the early 90s. This, for the first time, physically justifies the vortex wave system 
                directly from the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a joint work with Toan Nguyen, Penn State University.

                Recently the conservation of energy in the Euler equations (Onsager’s conjecture) was proved on compact Riemannian
                manifolds with boundary, with the velocity field in the Besov space $B^{1/3}_{3,1}$,  using intrinsic harmonic analysis (IHA) based on the
                heat kernel. <br>
                Now, by manually constructing the heat kernel with the techniques from microlocal analysis, we attain off-diagonal decay
                for all derivatives, and extend the result to a closed subspace of $B^{1/3}_{3,\infty}$ Some further developments of IHA are also given.

                The global existence of reaction-diffusion systems is now a classical topic, yet it still poses challenging open questions. 
                This talk reviews recent advances on this topic, addressing systems dissipating mass or entropy. I would like also to draw attention 
                to some interesting open questions.

                Stability estimates for Lagrangian solutions of scalar conservation laws and applications in Bayesian inversion.

                Many models in physics can be derived by some sort of hyperbolic conservation laws, such as wave propagation, gas dynamics or traffic flow. 
                The presence of shockwaves requires some special techniques to deal with the well-posedness of these problems. In this talk, we investigate 
                the scalar conservation law and introduce a Lagrangian representation for the entropy solution. The existence and uniqueness of Lagrangian solutions 
                are guaranteed by Filippov theory of differential equations. We prove that such a Lagrangian solution is compatible with the front tracking and 
                vanishing viscosity approximations in the sense that the approximate Lagrangian solution given by either of these methods converges uniformly 
                to the Lagrangian solution corresponding to the entropy solution of scalar conservation laws. For certain flux functions, illustrated by traffic 
                flow, we are able to obtain the convergence rates for the approximate Lagrangian solution with respect to changes in the initial field or flux 
                function by combining the front tracking method with Filippov theory. If time permits, we present an application of this approach in some Bayesian 
                inverse problems of recovering the initial field or flux function by tracking a particle trajectory.

                Let $\Omega \subset \R^N$ ($N \geq 3$) be a $C^2$ bounded domain and $F \subset \partial \Omega$ be a $C^2$ submanifold of dimension 
                $0 \leq k \leq N-2$. Put  $\delta_F(x)=\dist(x,F)$,  $V=\delta_F^{-2}$ in $\Omega$ and $L_{\gamma V}=\Delta + \gamma V$. Denote by  
                $C_H(V)$ the Hardy constant relative to $V$ in $\Omega$. <br>
                We study positive solutions of equations (LE) $-L_{\gamma V} u = 0$ and (NE) $-L_{\gamma V} u+ f(u) = 0$ in $\Omega$ when  
                $\gamma < C_H(V)$  and $f \in C(\R)$ is an odd, monotone increasing function. 
                We establish the existence of a normalized boundary trace for positive solutions of (LE)  and employ it to investigate the behavior 
                of subsolutions and super solutions of (LE) at the boundary. Using these results we study boundary value problems for (NE) 
                and derive a-priori estimates. Finally we discuss subcriticality of (NE) at boundary points of $\Omega$ and establish existence and 
                stability results when the data is concentrated on the set of subcritical points.
